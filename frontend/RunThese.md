# Run These Commands to Test Authentication

## 1. Start Backend (in one terminal)
```
cd backend && npm start
```

## 2. Start Frontend (in another terminal)
```
cd frontend && npx expo start --clear
```

## 3. THE CORRECT USER JOURNEY

We've completely fixed the user journey flow. Here's exactly what should happen:

### New Users:
1. **First Launch**: Initial loading screen → Login screen
2. **Register**: Enter details and create account
3. **Plan Selection**: After registration, user is automatically taken to Plan Selection
4. **Main App**: After selecting plans, user goes to Home screen

### Returning Users:
1. **First Launch**: Initial loading screen
2. **If No Saved Session**: Login screen → Enter credentials → Main App (with plans) 
3. **If Saved Session**: Main App directly

### For Testing:
- **Clear scenario**: Logout, clear AsyncStorage, restart app → should go to Login
- **Complete scenario**: Login → Select Plans → Main App
- This works for both email/password and social authentication methods

## IMPORTANT FIXES:

1. **Fixed Navigation Flow**:
   - LoadingScreen now properly checks authentication first
   - Unauthenticated users always go to Login screen
   - Authenticated users with no plans go to Plan Selection
   - Authenticated users with plans go to Main App

2. **Fixed API Configuration**:
   - All services now use the same dynamic API_BASE_URL
   - Works correctly in development with local backend
   - Will automatically switch to production URL when deployed

3. **Fixed Infinite Loop Issue**:
   - Added redirect history tracking
   - Limited retries to avoid endless loading
   - Added better error handling with clear user feedback

## Testing Tips
- Make sure your computer's IP address matches what's in the API configuration (192.168.1.112)
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
- If you have any issues, try the "Go to Login" button on the error screen
